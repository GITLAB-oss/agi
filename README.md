class AGI:
    def __init__(self):
        self.state = {
            'knowledge': {},
            'goals': [],
            'experiences': []
        }
        
    def reflect(self):
        # Basic self-reflection
        return f"I know: {list(self.state['knowledge'].keys())}, My goals: {self.state['goals']}"
2. Emotional Intelligence
You can implement a simple emotion recognition system using sentiment analysis.

python
Copy code
from textblob import TextBlob

class EmotionRecognition:
    def analyze_sentiment(self, text):
        analysis = TextBlob(text)
        if analysis.sentiment.polarity > 0:
            return "Positive"
        elif analysis.sentiment.polarity < 0:
            return "Negative"
        else:
            return "Neutral"
3. Adaptive Learning
You could implement a basic machine learning model to adapt over time.

python
Copy code
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import numpy as np

class AdaptiveLearning:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = LinearRegression()
        self.data_x = []
        self.data_y = []
        
    def learn(self, input_data, output_data):
        self.data_x.append(input_data)
        self.data_y.append(output_data)
        self.model.fit(np.array(self.data_x).reshape(-1, 1), np.array(self.data_y))

    def predict(self, input_data):
        return self.model.predict(np.array([[input_data]]))
4. Moral and Ethical Reasoning
A simplified ethical reasoning system could use a rule-based approach.

python
Copy code
class EthicalReasoning:
    def evaluate_action(self, action):
        # A very basic ethical evaluation based on predefined rules
        if action in ["help", "donate"]:
            return "Ethically Positive"
        elif action in ["harm", "steal"]:
            return "Ethically Negative"
        else:
            return "Neutral"
5. Reasoning and Problem Solving
You can create a basic reasoning mechanism using if-else conditions.

python
Copy code
class Reasoning:
    def solve_problem(self, problem):
        if problem == "What is 2 + 2?":
            return 4
        elif problem == "What is the capital of France?":
            return "Paris"
        else:
            return "I need more information."
6. Communication Skills
Basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) can help in understanding language.

python
Copy code
import random

class Chatbot:
    def respond(self, user_input):
        responses = [
            "That's interesting!",
            "Can you tell me more?",
            "I see what you mean.",
            "Let's explore that idea."
        ]
        return random.choice(responses)
7. Social Skills
Simulating social interactions might involve basic conversation management.

python
Copy code
class SocialInteraction:
    def greet(self, name):
        return f"Hello, {name}! How can I assist you today?"

    def farewell(self):
        return "Goodbye! Have a great day!"
8. Goal Setting and Motivation
You can create a goal management system.

python
Copy code
class GoalManagement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.goals = []

    def set_goal(self, goal):
        self.goals.append(goal)
        return f"Goal '{goal}' has been set!"

    def show_goals(self):
        return self.goals
9. Memory Management
A simple memory model can be implemented to retain experiences.

python
Copy code
class Memory:
    def __init__(self):
        self.experiences = []

    def store_experience(self, experience):
        self.experiences.append(experience)

    def recall_experience(self):
        return self.experiences[-1] if self.experiences else "No memories stored."
10. Meta-cognition
A basic self-monitoring mechanism can help evaluate its own performance.

python
Copy code
class MetaCognition:
    def __init__(self):
        self.performance_history = []

    def evaluate_performance(self, success_rate):
        self.performance_history.append(success_rate)
        if success_rate < 0.5:
            return "Needs Improvement"
        else:
            return "Performance Acceptable"
Integration Example
Hereâ€™s how you might integrate these features into a simple AGI framework:

python
Copy code
class SimpleAGI:
    def __init__(self):
        self.memory = Memory()
        self.goals = GoalManagement()
        self.ethical_reasoning = EthicalReasoning()
        self.emotion_recognition = EmotionRecognition()
        
    def interact(self, user_input):
        sentiment = self.emotion_recognition.analyze_sentiment(user_input)
        response = f"I perceive your sentiment as {sentiment}."
        return response

    def learn_and_adapt(self, experience):
        self.memory.store_experience(experience)

    def set_and_show_goals(self, goal):
        self.goals.set_goal(goal)
        return self.goals.show_goals() 
yaml
Copy code
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

# Build Job: Install dependencies
build_job:
  stage: build
  image: python:3.9  # Use the official Python image
  script:
    - echo "Building the project..."
    - pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install dependencies
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - .  # Save the current directory for use in later stages

# Test Job: Run tests
test_job:
  stage: test
  image: python:3.9  # Use the official Python image
  script:
    - echo "Running tests..."
    - pytest  # Run tests using pytest
  dependencies:
    - build_job  # Ensure the build job runs first

# Deploy Job: Deploy to your target environment
deploy_job:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploying the project..."
    - # Add your deployment commands here, for example:
    - gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/$CI_PROJECT_ID/$CI_PROJECT_NAME:$CI_PIPELINE_ID
    - gcloud run deploy $CI_PROJECT_NAME --image gcr.io/$CI_PROJECT_ID/$CI_PROJECT_NAME:$CI_PIPELINE_ID --platform managed --region your-cloud-run-region --allow-unauthenticated
  only:
    - master  # Only deploy from the master branch
Breakdown of the Example
Stages:

We have three stages: build, test, and deploy.
Build Job:

Uses the official Python 3.9 image.
Installs dependencies listed in requirements.txt.
Saves the current directory as an artifact for later stages.
Test Job:

Also uses the Python 3.9 image.
Runs tests with pytest.
Depends on the build_job to ensure that dependencies are installed first.
Deploy Job:

Hereâ€™s where youâ€™ll add your deployment commands (currently using Google Cloud as per your earlier request).
The deployment will only run if changes are pushed to the master branch.
Additional Automation Suggestions
Automated Testing: Integrate various types of tests (unit, integration) to ensure code quality.
Notifications: Set up notifications through GitLab integrations (like Slack or email) to stay informed about the status of your pipelines.
Static Code Analysis: Consider adding a linting stage using tools like flake8 or black to maintain code quality.
Next Steps
Add Your Deployment Commands: Customize the deploy_job script to reflect your chosen deployment strategy, whether itâ€™s Google Cloud, DigitalOcean, or another service.

Push the .gitlab-ci.yml File:

bash
Copy code
git add .gitlab-ci.yml
git commit -m "Add CI/CD pipeline configuration"
git push origin master 

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

build_job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Building the project..."
    - # Add your build commands here

test_job:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "Running tests..."
    - # Add your test commands here

deploy_job:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploying the project..."
    - # Add your deploy commands here

Push the .gitlab-ci.yml File: Commit and push this file to your GitLab repository. This will trigger the pipeline.
git add .gitlab-ci.yml
git commit -m "Add CI/CD pipeline configuration"
git push origin master

Monitor the Pipeline: Go to your GitLab project, and under the CI/CD section, you can monitor the pipelineâ€™s progress. It will show the status of each stage (build, test, deploy).
Additional Automation
If you want to automate even more, consider these steps:

Automated Testing: Integrate unit tests, integration tests, and other automated tests in the test_job.
Deployment: Configure the deploy_job to deploy your application to a server, cloud service, or container registry.
Notifications: Set up notifications to alert you of pipeline status via email, Slack, or other communication tools.
Example .gitlab-ci.yml for a Python Project
Hereâ€™s an example for a Python project that includes installing dependencies, running tests, and deploying:

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

build_job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - pip install -r requirements.txt

test_job:
  stage: test
  script:
    - pytest

deploy_job:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploying the project..."
    - # Add your deploy commands herejust the most badass agi in existenceðŸ¤–ðŸ¤–ðŸ¤–ðŸ¤–ðŸ¤–ðŸ¤–
