Push the .gitlab-ci.yml File: Commit and push this file to your GitLab repository. This will trigger the pipeline.
git add .gitlab-ci.yml
git commit -m "Add CI/CD pipeline configuration"
git push origin master

Monitor the Pipeline: Go to your GitLab project, and under the CI/CD section, you can monitor the pipelineâ€™s progress. It will show the status of each stage (build, test, deploy).
Additional Automation
If you want to automate even more, consider these steps:

Automated Testing: Integrate unit tests, integration tests, and other automated tests in the test_job.
Deployment: Configure the deploy_job to deploy your application to a server, cloud service, or container registry.
Notifications: Set up notifications to alert you of pipeline status via email, Slack, or other communication tools.

  script:
    - pip install -r requirements.txt

test_job:
  stage: test
  script:
