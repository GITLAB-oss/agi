    def __init__(self):
        self.performance_history = []

    def evaluate_performance(self, success_rate):
        self.performance_history.append(success_rate)
        if success_rate < 0.5:

yaml
Copy code
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

# Build Job: Install dependencies
build_job:
  stage: build
  image: python:3.9  # Use the official Python image
  script:
    - echo "Building the project..."
    - pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install dependencies
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - .  # Save the current directory for use in later stages

# Test Job: Run tests
test_job:
  stage: test
  image: python:3.9  # Use the official Python image
  script:
    - echo "Running tests..."
    - pytest  # Run tests using pytest
  dependencies:
    - build_job  # Ensure the build job runs first

# Deploy Job: Deploy to your target environment
deploy_job:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploying the project..."
    - # Add your deployment commands here, for example:
    - gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/$CI_PROJECT_ID/$CI_PROJECT_NAME:$CI_PIPELINE_ID
    - gcloud run deploy $CI_PROJECT_NAME --image gcr.io/$CI_PROJECT_ID/$CI_PROJECT_NAME:$CI_PIPELINE_ID --platform managed --region your-cloud-run-region --allow-unauthenticated
  only:
    - master  # Only deploy from the master branch
Breakdown of the Example
Stages:

We have three stages: build, test, and deploy.
Build Job:

Uses the official Python 3.9 image.
Installs dependencies listed in requirements.txt.
Saves the current directory as an artifact for later stages.
Test Job:

Also uses the Python 3.9 image.
Runs tests with pytest.
Depends on the build_job to ensure that dependencies are installed first.
Deploy Job:

Here’s where you’ll add your deployment commands (currently using Google Cloud as per your earlier request).
The deployment will only run if changes are pushed to the master branch.
Additional Automation Suggestions
Automated Testing: Integrate various types of tests (unit, integration) to ensure code quality.
Notifications: Set up notifications through GitLab integrations (like Slack or email) to stay informed about the status of your pipelines.
Static Code Analysis: Consider adding a linting stage using tools like flake8 or black to maintain code quality.
Next Steps
Add Your Deployment Commands: Customize the deploy_job script to reflect your chosen deployment strategy, whether it’s Google Cloud, DigitalOcean, or another service.

Push the .gitlab-ci.yml File:

bash
Copy code
git add .gitlab-ci.yml
git commit -m "Add CI/CD pipeline configuration"
git push origin master 

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

build_job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Building the project..."
    - # Add your build commands here

test_job:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "Running tests..."
    - # Add your test commands here

deploy_job:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploying the project..."
    - # Add your deploy commands here

Push the .gitlab-ci.yml File: Commit and push this file to your GitLab repository. This will trigger the pipeline.
git add .gitlab-ci.yml
git commit -m "Add CI/CD pipeline configuration"
git push origin master

Monitor the Pipeline: Go to your GitLab project, and under the CI/CD section, you can monitor the pipeline’s progress. It will show the status of each stage (build, test, deploy).
Additional Automation
If you want to automate even more, consider these steps:

Automated Testing: Integrate unit tests, integration tests, and other automated tests in the test_job.
Deployment: Configure the deploy_job to deploy your application to a server, cloud service, or container registry.
Notifications: Set up notifications to alert you of pipeline status via email, Slack, or other communication tools.
Example .gitlab-ci.yml for a Python Project
Here’s an example for a Python project that includes installing dependencies, running tests, and deploying:

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

build_job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - pip install -r requirements.txt

test_job:
  stage: test
  script:
    - pytest

deploy_job:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploying the project..."
    - # Add your deploy commands herejust the most badass agi in existence🤖🤖🤖🤖🤖🤖
